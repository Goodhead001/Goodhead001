- 👋 Hi, I’m @Goodhead001
- 👀 I’m interested in Algebra and Number Theory 
- 🌱 I'm skilled in algebra, number theory, mathematical modeling, and data-driven problem solving.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow mathematicians, data scientists, and researchers interested in algebra, number theory, and innovative applications of mathematics in data science and modeling.
- 📫 How to reach me: donaldgoodhead01@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields not only shape modern mathematics but also play a key role in cryptography and coding theory? Without them, secure online communication wouldn't be possible!
